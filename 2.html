        <p>Hi, Lili!</p>
        <p>
            Guess what?! </p>
        <p>For the past few hours I've been researching how elephants make very low frequency sounds below what we can hear and this has lead me to think about how we talk and cats purr!</p>
        <p> Humans can speak because when we exhale, air flows through our larynxes. You can feel your larynx with your hand on your throat. It's that hard thing under your skin. You can especially feel a larynx on a men because the hyoid bone around their larynx is bigger â€” itâ€™s their Adamâ€™s apple!</p>
        <p>Our larynxes contain these little membranous, stringy things that cover our windpipe called vocal cords. Depending on how they're positioned, when we breathe out, pressure changes in the airflow of our breath cause them to do vibrate and make different sounds. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4xQ16pHKsA">This</a> is an awesome video of a singer's vocal cords. </p>
        <video loop autoplay src="./media/elephant-larynx.mp4"></video>
        <p>Elephants do this same thing, but because their vocal chords are much bigger, they can make much, much lower sounds. Sounds so low, we canâ€™t hear them (20 hz). And my understanding is that low sounds are like thunder. You can actually <i>feel</i> their vibrations if you're paying attention.</p>
        <p>In researching how elephants make these low infrasounds, I discovered that cats also make low sounds but in a different way than how we speak or how elephants make sounds. They don't vibrate their vocal cords passively with their breath. Instead, they actively vibrate them with their brain and then they breathe. Because they're actively vibrating their vocal chords with their nervous system, cats with paralyzed laryngeal nerves can't purr ðŸ˜¬. Unlike us, they purr when their breathing in and out. We speak only when we breathe out.</p>
        <p>To figure out if elephants were producing sounds the way cat's purr (vibration via the brain and then breathing) or the way we talk (vibration via our breath) scientists took a dead elephant's larynx and blew air through it. The vocal cords vibrated to make really low sounds. So, they think that like us, elephants make seismic sounds similar to the way we speak. And their vocal cords are just so big they can make incredibly low sounds. Elephants have this special fat around the nares (or nostril holes) in their skulls that may help to amplify (not sure exactly how this works or what this means!) the sound waves. They think this is similar to the way that dolphins have fat in their head that amplifies the ultrasonic (very high frequency) sounds they produce when they echolocate. These infrasounds travel through the air and the ground and other elephants can hear and feel them. How they feel them â€” that's for next time!</p>
        <p>Love,</p>
