        <p>
            I remember when the daily mail was dished out at sleepaway camp. When there was a letter for me, the counselors called would call my name. I'd be elated. I'd see my mom's handwriting on the envelope and tear open the seal to read about whatever mundane goings-on had occured at home in my absence.
        </p>
        <p>I haven't been at sleepaway camp for...decades. But I was thinking about the aesthetic of middle school letters and big loopy handwriting, stickers, SWAK, doodles, and other good stuff and how I wanted to make something like that for you. </p>
        <p>We live on different coasts but we talk all of the time on the phone. The phone is fun but not as fun as middle-schoolish letters. I thought it'd be fun to have the feeling of getting a postcard from me each week. So the reasonable thing to do would be to just send a postcard, and maybe I'll do that too;) </p>
        <p>But since we already talk on the phone each week about our lives, I thought it'd be fun to send you something each week that's about something besides life. I was thinking of things you like and things I like, and I obviously came up with a topic that I could write you about each week: ELEPHANTS!</p>
        <p>I love learning about animals and am always trying to come up with new ways of getting to know them that helps me feel closer to them. </p>
        <p>So...I thought it'd be fun if I send you a digital postcard every week for a year with some information about elephants. In the process of reading, writing, and drawing pictures about elephants, I hoped to get to know them in new ways that would feel more personal and deep than "just" reading about them. And now that I've made a lot of things about them, even though I'm not actually in their presence, I <i>do</i> feel closer to elephants! And maybe after receiving a "digital postcard" from me each week, you will too!</p>
        <p>I made each "postcard" by thinking of a question I had about elephants (e.g. How do elephants seismically communicate), researching that question (i.e. reading different articles, coming up with more how and why questions, and then answering as many questions as I could). After I synthesized some kind of understanding in my head, I wrote my "postcard" to you about what I learned and then drew some pictures/animations that capture some of what I'm feeling and thinking about what I've read and thought about. Each postcard took be a while because it was hard for me to figure out how things work and to decode the science-speak in the articles I read!</p>
        <p>Anyway, in these postcards I primarily explored topics about elephant bodies. I bet there are other things (e.g. ecology, conservation) about elephants that you'd be more interested in but most of the rabbit holes I found myself going down involved questions about how elephants' bodies work.</p>
        <p>Anyway, I love you and hope that this will make you smile, learn cool stuff, and may even entertain you on your commute and perhaps make you even feel closer to elephants in your daily life.</p>
        <p>Love you, Lili and HAPPY BIRTHDAY!</p>
        <p>Love,</p>
        <p>Molly</p>
        <p>P.S. <a href="1.html">Here's</a> the first Camp Elephant Letter!</p>
        <p>P.P.S. The letters are given in the order they were made so the earlier ones are probably worse than the later ones because I was just figuring out how to make them!!</p>
